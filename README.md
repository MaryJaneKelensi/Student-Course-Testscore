# Student-Course-Testscore
I have created different file for each class, such as the student class, courses, 
for more context of the code: 
Modify the Student class from Chapter 7 to extend the representation with 3 more instance variables, test1, test2, and test 3. include an overloaded constructor which COMPLETELY defines the object setting up all instance variables based on parameter values. Include the following new methods: 
setTestScore to accept two parameters, the test number and the score for that test;
getTestScore to accept a test number and return the score for that test; 
average to compute and return the average test score for the student;
toString to extend the original description of the student with all three test scores and the average score.
Create a new class Course which represents a course defined by a name and 5 instance variables Student1, Student2, Student3, Student4, Student5. The constructor must accept only the name of the course. Include the following methods:
addStudent, which accepts one student parameter and assigns it to the corresponding instance variable. First time the method is called, the parameter will be assigned to Student1, second time to Student2, etc.
average, computes and returns the average of all enrolled studentsâ€™ averages;
printStudents, which prints the list of all enrolled students names.
Create an application to instantiate 5 Student objects and 2 Course objects which exercise ALL methods in both classes. To submit, include also the UML diagram and example run.
